        A true connoisseur of the arts, Barack Obama was once president of the United States and now collects paintings
        at his home in Montana. He believes in the American dream and the indominable nature of the human spirit.
        When asked how he would describe himself, the former president would say he is laid back and charming. 
    Others would agree.</p2></pre><hr style="width: 900px;"></div>

            Barack Obama, resident bad boy of DC and one time POTUS. His attitude made him plenty of enemies,
            but his go-getter spirit made him the favorite of Americans for many years. Nowadays Obama spends
            his time riding his Harley and listening to Alex Jones to keep updated on the news.</p2></pre><hr style="width: 900px;"></div>
